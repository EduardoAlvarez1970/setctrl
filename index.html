        <p>SetCTRL is an electronic music project rooted in minimalism, abstraction and sound design. Built around controlled systems, repetition and micro-variation, the project explores tension, space and texture as core musical elements.

Influenced by experimental electronic aesthetics and modular thinking, SetCTRL prioritizes atmosphere and structure over conventional dynamics, creating immersive and introspective sound environments.</p>
